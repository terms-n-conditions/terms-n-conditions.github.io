This Artwork (‘Artwork’) is being exhibited in the following address: Broom Gallery, 
(12, 167-Gil,  Nonhyeon-ro, Seoul, South Korea), and was created by Helen Hyunah Oh, 
a Korean female artist based in South Korea. This Terms and Conditions is considered the artwork itself.
<br/><br/></br></br></br>

1. DEFINITIONS<br/><br/>

THE ARTWORK : This piece of artwork (‘The Artwork’) consists of the following : <br/>
(a) a (PLEASE ENTER MODEL NAME) tablet produced in XXXXX,) , <br/>
(b) the software, developed by the artist, that runs to display the content, <br/>
(c)  Terms and Conditions and ALL of the content hereof, and the reader or the audience, 
who interacts with the screen on the tablet described as above.</br>
<br/><br/><br/>
THE ARTIST: The artist’s name is Hyunah Oh, a South Korean artist based and currently resides in South Korea, and has written the content for item A.
<br/><br/>
THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS : This group of texts and paragraph is defined as “the Terms and Conditions“
This is actually NOT a real terms and conditions in the usual sense. 
This is more like a medium that the person stated in item B chose to deliver the message for item A. 
The terms and conditions are the essential parts of this artwork.
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>


2. TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT<br/><br/>
This agreement is a real agreement taking place between the artist and the reader(“YOU”), and contains the following items: 
<br/><br/><br/>

(i) ABANDONMENT OF PERSONAL RIGHTS<br/>
By agreeing with this Terms and Conditions, you grant the artist the right to :</br>
Record your interaction with this artwork in video format without prior consent or notice with you and the person(s) being recorded</br>
Edit, publish and share the recorded videos with third party entities, including the press and educational institutions located in the United States
</br></br>

(ii) MATTER OF INTEREST</br>
This Artwork was inspired by the 2015 film, ‘Big Short,’ starring Christian Bale. In the film based on actual stories. Michael Burry, in his prolonged study of the long terms and conditions of mortgage funds, notices that these financial products are extremely risky. After reading thousands of pages of what these assets are ACTUALLY about, he notices that what people believed to be stable financial assets, graded AAA or above, were actually a group of sub-subprime loans at very high risk of going default. After discovering this, he runs to Goldman Sachs to create custom CDOs, shorting on the existing subprime bonds, for which people laughed at him at that time. In 2008, the very thing that he has been betting on really happened: the financial crisis in which the Lehman Brothers go default.  In the end, he successfully claims his share. All this was possible because Michael Burry, as eccentric as he was, actually had the guts to read through thousands of pages to discover the very truth that no one, even the ones who were selling them, could see. In my opinion, this 2008 subprime mortgage crisis was in fact a crisis based on tiny text: millions of people were counting their lives on something they did not even know because they did not choose to read the disclaimers carefully. 
</br></br>
Quite surprisingly, this is still the case. Although many people would remember the 2008 financial crisis as the result of corruption on the part of Wall Street professionals, they still never choose to actually read through what these corrupt people are offering them. When you go to a bank to open an account, purchase a financial asset, when you buy insurance, when you are about to enter an important medical surgery, you are encountering long lists in tiny text. Human beings seem to have an inherent disgust for tiny texts. In a way, I think people are forced to skip the complexity of legal literature, considering the amount of text and the time it takes to actually read all of the truths stated in ugly syntax and jargon. There is the human instinct to hate something so complex and boring, and there is the social pressure. You will seriously consider someone crazy or out of his or her mind if someone really tries to read the terms and conditions of several financial instruments. History can repeat itself because people fail to learn from them. At the expense of instant gratification and comfort, most of us do not choose to read through the disclaimers. This means that upon entering any kind of agreement, being it a simple purchase, registering on a website, or purchasing a financial asset, people do not actually know or even try to know the exacting details, where great dangers might lie. This is what the ARTIST wants to call attention to.
</br></br>

(iii) POSSIBLE PURPOSE</br>
Here are quite obvious reasons why corporations, lawyers, and all other important parties would try to construct terms and conditions that no one would want to read : 
</br></br>

ESCAPE LIABILITIES: Hiding complex truths and facts becomes most efficient and convenient when you make people not know about it. Long texts and complexity in legal literature are the best ways to escape from all legal risks, since, regardless of whether they actually read them or not, you already “told” the consumer about all the risks. In the court, it does not matter HOW you presented the truth. Once you have “shown” it to the consumer, it is now up to the consumer to read through the legal literature. Unfair, but truthfully right and just, according to the court.
</br></br>

MAXIMIZE PROFITABILITY: No one will buy a “natural” face cream once they find out that only 0.2% of the content is actually consisted of eucalyptus oil and the rest 99.8% are actually derived from petroleum by-products. No one, in his or her right mind, would have chosen to purchase mortgage-based bonds if they knew that they were comprised of subprime mortgages. Also, fewer people would be so confidently and complacently active on Facebook if they know every single word they type in would be accessible to Facebook. Disclaimers, agreements, terms and conditions, all the necessary legal literature that surrounds every transaction in contemporary society serves profitability than scrutiny.
</br></br>

(iv) CASE STUDY</br>
The purpose of this section is to illustrate some similar cases agreements as this case.  At some point, firms have begun to hide risks, truths, and complexity all under the long disclaimers, contracts, and terms of use.  
</br><br />
Google Inc. : The ARTIST has read through Google’s service terms and conditions verbatim, and found out that Google Inc. can use, distribute, and publish user content that has been uploaded, distributed, and downloaded through any of the Google services. This means that if Google chooses to publish or use your family photos from last vacation, you can never sue them. According to their terms of service, although the content actually belongs to you, they have full rights to use them as they like, as long as they do not “own” the contents. You already have agreed to the terms of use when you decided to register and use Google services.
</br><br />
Facebook : Ever since Cambridge Analytica crisis, it is now common sense to know that Facebook has sold user data and changed their terms and conditions (which again, has been widely “skipped” and unread by many users) accordingly to avoid legal responsibility. As we can see from this crisis, many people will already know this, but changing your privacy settings would not stop the company from collecting your data. No matter what, once you are a registered user active on Facebook, the company can see your usage time duration, frequency, your network settings, GPS, data about your friends (who they are, who you are particularly close to) and every single content on your facebook account, regardless of whether you chose to openly publish on your timeline or keep to yourself. Every single word you speak, every single comment, photo, and video you upload on Facebook will eventually be accessible to the company. Although they would not openly share the data with others, they still have full access to all of your data, metadata, and virtually ANY trace you leave on the apps or the website. They seem to be reassuring panicking users by saying that they never collect personal information with which they can identify you, but that does not stop them from freely collecting your contents and metadata around your usage.
<br/><br/><br/><br/></br>


3. CONDITIONS<br/><br/>
This agreement is, or is considered valid if the following conditions are met:</br>
* In case where you read part or all of this Terms and Conditions</br>
* In case where you click on the “YES” button at the end of this webpage</br>
<br/><br/><br/><br/>



4. LIABILITIES<br/><br/>

The Artist has no liability to financially or in any other way compensate the reader or any other person for reading or agreeing with this agreement.. If you get physically injured or in any other circumstances need any compensation, please contact the owner of the Broom Gallery at +82-2-
</br>
Generally, to escape from the potential risks and liabilities entailed in disclaimers, terms and conditions, and all kinds of legal literature we face in life  that we ignore so frequently and skip so much, we would need to do the following to make sure that we know in detail what we are about to do or purchase. The following are some ways or illustrations where you can avoid the risks:
</br></br>
(i) Read through every single contract terms and conditions you face : This might sound like nonsense, but this is by far the most cost-effective way to learn everything about what you are trying to do or purchase. If you try to do this when you go to a bank, the bank teller would think you are mad, crazy, or a psycho who has an obsession disorder.
</br><br />
(ii) Hiring a reliable lawyer of your own : This, although highly unrealistic in financial terms, would actually be the best way to avoid any risk in life. However, very few, if ever, people can afford to hire a lawyer every time he or she has to make purchases or make big decisions in their personal lives. This is total nonsense.
</br><br />
(iii) Making or using software : This method includes creating a software that reads, analyzes and summarizes the whole terms and conditions. That software would eventually break down and explain what the legal text entails by showing the summary in comprehensive, colloquial language that any layperson can decipher. Sounds like a dream, but some startups are already at work, such as Lexion, eBrevia, ThoughtRiver, Cognitiv+, and Kira Systems. If you are really interested, you may want to learn more about these firms and try to use their services for your own purposes.
</br><br />
(iv) Sharing knowledge in online communities or reading articles about policies : This would be the most common way Users or consumers, we can always write reviews and share our points of view online to make sure that we are all safe. However, just like all of the options stated above, this is again not practical, since we have no time or money that much. It is simply nonsense to do any of the aforementioned actions for efficiency’s sake.

6. REMARKS<br/><br/>

If you have actually read this terms and conditions up to this point, you seem to be a perons incredibly difficult to fool or deceive. Indeed, as human beings residing in the 21st century contemporary society, it is important for people to be able to question and look for the details, as too many transactions and exchanges of resources entails legal literature, and the complexity and the burden on the average consumer is becoming heavier. Unfortunately, all products and services are becoming incredibly clever in hiding the key facts in easy and simple user interface and design. Even elementary school kids can order something through Alexa and know how to register on Facebook. The big question is: who is it that make all people eventually a dunce who signs stupid agreements or ignore the truth by not paying attention? Is it the egregious corporations who, for pursuit of profit, hide the truths in tiny indecipherable text so as to escape from legal risks and make a fool of everyone? Or, rather, is it us who allow ourselves to be conceited because it is simply so convenient to ignore the details and is so complacent now that we never suspicion that anything bad is going to happen?
