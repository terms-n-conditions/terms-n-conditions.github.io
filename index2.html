THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. 
ANY CHANGES WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS POSTED TO THIS ARTWORK FROM TIME TO TIME. 
<br />
</br></br>
This Artwork (‘Artwork’) is being exhibited on the following URL: terms-n-conditions.github.io, or anywhere else the Artist wishes to exhibit, and was created by Helen Oh, 
a Korean female artist based in South Korea. This Terms and Conditions is considered the artwork itself.
<br/><br/></br></br></br>

1. DEFINITIONS<br/><br/>

THE ARTWORK : This piece of artwork (‘The Artwork’) consists of the following : </br>
(a) an electronic device to display the Artwork, </br></br>
(b) a browser app, and any other app(s) running on the device mentioned above in (a), 
that runs to display the content,</br></br>
(c) Terms and Conditions and ALL of the content hereof, and the reader or the audience, 
who interacts with the screen on the tablet described as above.</br>
</br></br>
THE ARTIST: The artist’s full legal name is Hyunah Oh, a South Korean artist based and currently resides in South Korea, 
and has written, constructed and designed this legal literature and the web page platform to present it.
<br/><br/>
THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS : This document is defined as “the Terms and Conditions.“
This is a combination of an actual, legally binding contract and
additional information to help the reader or the audience to reevaluate their point of view on 
the existing terms and conditions they have encountered in their lives.
This Terms and Conditions is a medium that the Artist chooses to deliver her message. 
The Terms and Conditions itself is the essential part of this artwork. </br></br>
EYESIGHT : This Terms and Conditions define "eyesight" according to the Oxford Learner's Dictionary definition of "eyesight," 
as "the abiliy to see things." 
Please note that the short text and prompt that appears on the first page of this Artwork is a pun to make fun of 
how voluntarily "blind" people become when they are faced with legal literature. 
This Artwork has nothing to do with actual eyesight testing in the quantified, standardized, literal sense. 
Instead, this Artwork presents a hypothetical eyesight testing where people have to make a conscious  
effort to recognize or make out the letters that they are seeing.
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>


2. TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT<br/><br/>
This agreement is a real agreement taking place between the artist and the reader or the audience(“YOU”), 
and consists of the following items: 
<br/><br/><br/>

(i) ABANDONMENT OF PERSONAL RIGHTS<br/>
By agreeing with this Terms and Conditions, you grant the artist the right to :</br></br>
(a) Record your interaction with this artwork in sound and video format without prior consent 
with you and the person(s) that appear in the video
</br></br>
(b) Edit, publish and share the recorded videos with third parties, 
including the press, art galleries, and prestigious educational institutions located in the United States
</br></br>
(c) Measure the speed with which you interact with this artwork</br>
</br></br>
(d) Feature representations of you in pornography.</br>
</br></br></br>

(ii) MATTER OF INTEREST</br>
This Artwork was inspired by the 2015 film, ‘Big Short.' Unlike other media or literature around the 2008 sub-prime mortgage crisis, 
which laments the detrimental aspect of this crisis, 'Big Short' focuses on those who made a fortune out of that crisis. 
Michael Burry is a hedgefund manager with an M.D., who, after reading through the long terms and conditions of mortgage funds all through to the end, 
notices that these financial products(many rated AAA or above) are actually very risky, based on loans to those whose chances of paying it back seems extremely low. 
Burry notices that what people believed to be stable financial assets, graded AAA or above, 
were actually a group of sub-subprime loans at very high risk of going default. 
After discovering this, he runs to Goldman Sachs to create custom CDOs, 
shorting on the existing subprime mortgage bonds, for which people laughed at him at that time. 
At the same time, some other hedgefund managers began to agree with Burry's point of view and started shorting, too.
In 2008, the very thing that he has been betting on really happened: major banks, including Lehman Brothers, start to go default. 
In the end, those who denied to take things for granted and started looking deeper into the texts successfully claimed 
their share of fortune when everyone else was losing money. dtually had the guts to read through thousands of pages to discover the very truth that no one, even the ones who were selling them, could see. In my opinion, this 2008 subprime mortgage crisis was in fact a crisis based on tiny text: millions of people were counting their lives on something they did not even know 
because they did not choose to read the disclaimers carefully. 
</br></br>
Quite surprisingly, this is still the case. 
Although many people would remember the 2008 financial crisis as the result of corruption on the part of Wall Street 
professionals, which is true to some extent, 
they still fail to notice the most important take-away from this crisis: you need to know what contract you are entering into. 

When you go to a bank to open an account, purchase a financial asset, when you buy insurance, 
when you are about to enter an important medical surgery, you almost always encounter disclaimers and agreements. 

At the expense of instant gratification and comfort, most of us do not choose to read through the disclaimers. 
Human beings seem to have an inherent disgust for tiny texts. This is an understandable phenomenon, since human beings 
naturally shuns too much information, which means too much precessing and consuming of energy. 
In a way, with this natural design of the human body and perception, 
people are forced to skip the complexity of legal literature, 
considering the amount of text and the time it takes to actually read all of the truths stated in ugly syntax and jargon. 
And there is the social pressure. You, along with all other people, will  
consider someone crazy or out of his or her mind if someone really tries to read through a 10-page 
terms and conditions when creating a bank account. History can repeat itself because people fail to learn from them. 

This means that upon entering any kind of agreement, being it a simple purchase, 
registering on a web-based service, or purchasing a financial asset, 
people do not actually know or even try to know the exacting details, where the greatest dangers might lie. 
This is what the ARTIST wants to call attention to.
</br></br>

(iii) PURPOSE</br>
Here are some possible reasons why corporations, professionals, and all other parties 
would try to construct legal literature in tiny texts so that no one would want to read : 
</br></br>

(a) LIABILITIES: Hiding complex truths and facts can become most efficient and convenient 
by making people not know about it or skip it. Long texts and complexity in legal literature are the best ways 
to escape from all legal risks, since, regardless of whether they actually read them or not, 
you already “told” the consumer about all the risks. In the court, it does not matter 
HOW you presented the truth. Once you have “shown” it to the consumer, 
it is now up to the consumer to read through the legal literature. Unfair, but truthfully right and just, 
according to the court.
</br></br>

(b) PROFITABILITY: No one will buy a “natural”-labeled face cream once they find out that 
only 0.2% of the content is actual eucalyptus oil and the rest 99.8% are actually derived 
from petroleum by-products. No one, in his or her right mind, would have chosen to purchase mortgage-based bonds 
if they knew that they were comprised of subprime mortgages. 
Also, fewer people would be so confidently and complacently active on Facebook 
if they know every single word they type in would be accessible to Facebook. 
Disclaimers, agreements, terms and conditions, all the necessary legal literature that surrounds 
every transaction in contemporary society serves profitability than scrutiny.
</br></br>

(c) MATTER OF EFFICIENCY: On the other hand, pure text is the most efficient way to present something when you want to save costs.
Designing,editing, presenting, and testing takes a lot of time and money away from corporations, so they choose to put their
best effort only on some (partial) product truth they want to highlight or draw attention to. This may be the biggest reason
why we encounter a giant body of text every time we would like to be alert just for a little while before we are about to have a transaction.

</br></br>

(iv) ON RELATED SERVICES </br>
The purpose of this section is to illustrate some similar cases agreements as this case. 
At some point, firms have begun to hide risks, truths, and complexity all under the long disclaimers, 
contracts, and terms of use.  
</br></br>
(a) Google Inc. : The ARTIST has read through Google’s service terms and conditions verbatim, 
and found out that Google Inc. can use, distribute, and publish user content that has been uploaded, 
distributed, and downloaded through any of the Google services. This means that if Google chooses 
to publish or use your family photos from last vacation, you can never sue them. According to their terms of service, 
although the content actually belongs to you, they have full rights to use them as they like, 
as long as they do not “own” the contents. You already have agreed to the terms of use when you decided to 
register and use Google services.
</br><br/>
(b) Facebook : Ever since the famous Cambridge Analytica crisis, it is now common sense to know that Facebook sells 
user data and has changed their terms and conditions (which again, has been widely “skipped” and unread by many users) 
accordingly to avoid legal responsibility. Many people will already know that  
changing your privacy settings would not stop the company from collecting your data. No matter what, 
once you are a registered user active on Facebook, the company can see your usage time duration, frequency, 
your network settings, GPS, data about your friends (who they are, who you are particularly close to) and every 
single content on your facebook account, regardless of whether you chose to openly publish on your timeline or keep all 
to yourself. Every single word, every single comment or emotional expression, all photos and videos you upload on Facebook 
will be accessible to the company. Although they would not openly share the data with others, they still have full access to 
all of your data, metadata, and virtually any trace you leave on your account or on the entire website. 
They seem to be reassuring users by saying that they never collect personal information with which they can identify you, 
but it would really help to keep in mind that as long as they have access to all of your photos, 
they can virtually identify you, and nothing will stop them from collecting your contents and metadata for free of charge.
</br></br>
(c) Amazon Digital Services LLC: The popular voice assistant service provided by Amazon, 
Alexa Terms of Use seems harless at first sight. However, a careful reading of this Terms and Conditions reveals that
 anything you say to Alexa from any device will be used for training Alexa to be smarter, analyzing the acoustic pattern of your voice, and remembering your voice for more personalized services. 
Unless you delete part or all of your voice recordings in the Settings in your Alexa app, your voice recordings will be stored 
in the Amazon server for three full years, even if you have stopped using the service. 
Another interesting part is how they define purchase of digital contents.
If you accidentally make a purchase of digital content by talking to Alexa, your purchase is considered final. 
Although the Terms of Use suggests that you can request for refund, any request should be made by calling customer service, 
which means you have to call them within their working hours and wait for your turn to reach the service agent when their line is busy.
</br></br>
(d) Kakao Account Terms and Conditions: Kakao Talk is one of the most popular free messenger apps in South Korea. 
As a result of the Artist's careful study of its Account Terms and Conditions delivers a shocking discovery: 
you can prohibit or suspend any one of your friends from using Kakao Talk by capturing any part of the conversation. 
In "Article 10. Obligation of the Members," Kakao suggests the following are considered as violating the terms of Service: 
</br></br>

10. Collect, store and/or disclose other Member's personal information</br>
</br>
As soon as you share your parents' phone numbers over Kakao Talk, or share someone's phone number without that person noticing,
you can be suspended from using Kakao Talk, which is nonsense considering how many times we share numbers willingly or unwillingly over instant messengers.
People might think that this is a harmless phrase to protect the majority from harm. However, this phrase can be used to 
ban anyone from usage, depending on interpretation. </br></br>

<br/><br/><br/><br/></br>


3. CONDITIONS<br/><br/>
This agreement is, or is considered valid if the following conditions are met:</br>
(a) In case where you read part or all of this Terms and Conditions</br>
(b) In case where you click on the “YES” button at the end of this webpage</br>
(c) In case you are NOT a blind person, for whom this Artwork is irrelevant </br<>
<br/><br/><br/><br/></br>


4. LIABILITIES<br/><br/>

The Artist has no liability to financially or in any other way compensate 
the reader or any other person for reading and agreeing with this agreement. 
</br></br>
The Artist, however, can hold you liable for:</br>
(a) Damaging any part of the software or the hardware composing this Artwork. This includes removing any component, 
including the tablet PC itself, of this Artwork.</br>
(b) Hampering with the exhibition of the Artwork. This includes physically tainting 
the Artwork or the surrounding area, shutting down the software, and unplugging the hardware.</br>
(c) Recording this Artwork in any medium, including sound, picture, text, and video, 
without asking for prior permission from the Artist.</br>
(d) Publishing or sharing any of the illegitimate recording as mentioned in (c).
</br></br>
Generally, to escape from the potential risks and liabilities entailed in disclaimers, 
terms and conditions, and all kinds of legal literature we face in life that we ignore so frequently and skip so much, 
we would need to do the following to make sure that we know in detail what we are about to do or purchase. 
The following are some ways or illustrations where you can avoid the risks:
</br></br>
(i) Read through every single contract terms and conditions you face : This might sound like nonsense, but this is by far the most cost-effective way to learn everything about what you are trying to do or purchase. If you try to do this when you go to a bank, the bank teller would think you are mad, crazy, or a psycho who has an obsession disorder.
</br><br />
(ii) Hiring a reliable lawyer of your own : This, although highly unrealistic in financial terms, would actually be the best way to avoid any risk in life. However, very few, if ever, people can afford to hire a lawyer every time he or she has to make purchases or make big decisions in their personal lives. This is total nonsense.
</br><br />
(iii) Making or using software : This method includes creating a software that reads, analyzes and summarizes the whole terms and conditions. That software would eventually break down and explain what the legal text entails by showing the summary in comprehensive, colloquial language that any layperson can decipher. Sounds like a dream, but some startups are already at work, such as Lexion, eBrevia, ThoughtRiver, Cognitiv+, and Kira Systems. If you are really interested, you may want to learn more about these firms and try to use their services for your own purposes.
</br><br />
(iv) Sharing knowledge in online communities or reading articles about policies : This would be the most common way Users or consumers, we can always write reviews and share our points of view online to make sure that we are all safe. However, just like all of the options stated above, this is again not practical, since we have no time or money that much. It is simply nonsense to do any of the aforementioned actions for efficiency’s sake.
<br/><br/><br/><br/></br>

6. REMARKS<br/><br/>

If you have actually read this terms and conditions up to this point, 
you seem to be the difficult, picky type of person extremely hard to deceive.
Indeed, as we live the 21st century contemporary society where everything is fast and satisfying, 
it is important for people to be able to question and look for the details, 
as too many transactions and exchanges of resources entail legal literature and processes, 
and the complexity and the burden on the average consumer is becoming heavier. 

We undertand that nowadays, information is consumed in just a few seconds. 
With the advancement of visual languages and comercially simplified 
buttons and shortcuts, products and services are becoming increasingly clever in hiding 
the key facts in easy and simple interface design. 
Interfaces are becoming so simple and easy that even elementary school kids can order something through Alexa and know how to register on Facebook. 
Are we willingly becoming fools in pursuit of speed and instant gratification? Or, 
is it the egregious corporations who, for pursuit of profit, 
hide the truths in tiny indecipherable text so as to escape from legal risks and make a fool of everyone? 
It is the former: with a click or a swipe to sign or admit something, we so willingly allow 
ourselves to be conceited because it is simply so convenient to ignore the 
details and is so complacent now that we never suspicion that anything bad is going to happen. 
We are even allowing them to hide their dark intentions better with advanced methods and tactics. 
It is time that this stops and corporations, institutions, and professionals to 
begin to allowing consumers to see more truths in a trasaction before it takes place.
</br></br></br>
Having read this terms and conditions up to this point you have entered a valid agreement with the Artist, 
according to which you must not disclose the secrets to other audiences around you in the gallery. 
If you agree with the Artist's point of view that people are voluntarily or involuntarily being deceived by tiny texts in contemporary society, 
please click on the button below. By clicking on this button, you will automatically be directed to the top of this page,   
since this is the artwork itself. I hope you enjoyed reading through this.
